/etc/pdnsd.conf
===============

pdnsd in Debian will default to AUTO_MODE, which will use
configuration files in /usr/share/pdnsd/pdnsd-$AUTO_MODE,
which contain resonable defaults for most cases.

If you wish to customize the values, set up to MANUAL mode, and edit
/etc/pdnsd.conf. You can copy the file from
/usr/share/pdnsd/pdnsd-$AUTO_MODE to /etc/pdnsd.conf to use as a
template.

To set up MANUAL mode, remove the AUTO_MODE= definition in /etc/default/pdnsd.
