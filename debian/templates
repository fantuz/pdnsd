_Description: General type of pdnsd configuration:
 Please select the pdnsd configuration method that best meets your needs.
 .
  - Use resolvconf  : use informations provided by resolvconf.
  - Use root servers: make pdnsd behave like a caching, recursive DNS
                      server.
  - Manual          : completely manual configuration. The pdnsd daemon
                      will not start until you edit /etc/pdnsd.conf and
                      /etc/default/pdnsd.
 .
 Note: If you already use a DNS server that listens to 127.0.0.1:53,
 you have to choose "Manual".
